get_acoustic_deployments(
  connection = con,
  deployment_id = NULL,
  receiver_id = NULL,
  acoustic_project_code = NULL,
  station_name = NULL,
  open_only = FALSE

}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A connection to the ETN database. Defaults to \code{con}.}

\item{deployment_id}{Integer (vector). One or more deployment identifiers.}

\item{receiver_id}{Character (vector). One or more receiver identifiers.}

\item{acoustic_project_code}{Character (vector). One or more acoustic
project codes. Case-insensitive.}

\item{station_name}{Character (vector). One or more deployment station
names.}

\item{open_only}{Logical. Restrict deployments to those that are currently
open (i.e. no end date defined). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with acoustic deployment data, sorted by
\code{acoustic_project_code}, \code{station_name} and \code{deploy_date_time}. See also

}
\description{
Get data for deployments of acoustic receivers, with options to filter
results.
}
\examples{
# Set default connection variable
con <- connect_to_etn()

# Get all acoustic deployments
get_acoustic_deployments(con)

# Get specific acoustic deployment
get_acoustic_deployments(con, deployment_id = 1437)

# Get acoustic deployments for a specific receiver
get_acoustic_deployments(con, receiver_id = "VR2W-124070")

# Get open acoustic deployments for a specific receiver
get_acoustic_deployments(con, receiver_id = "VR2W-124070", open_only = TRUE)

# Get acoustic deployments for a specific acoustic project
get_acoustic_deployments(con, acoustic_project_code = "demer")

# Get acoustic deployments for two specific stations
get_acoustic_deployments(con, station_name = c("de-9", "de-10"))
