#' Get cpod deployment data
#'
#' Get data for deployments of cpod receivers, with options to filter
#' results.
#'
#' @param connection A connection to the ETN database. Defaults to `con`.
#' @param deployment_id Integer (vector). One or more deployment identifiers.
#' @param receiver_id Character (vector). One or more receiver identifiers.
#' @param cpod_project_code Character (vector). One or more cpod
#'   project codes. Case-insensitive.
#' @param station_name Character (vector). One or more deployment station
#'   names.
#' @param open_only Logical. Restrict deployments to those that are currently
#'   open (i.e. no end date defined). Defaults to `FALSE`.
#'
#' @return A tibble with cpod deployment data, sorted by
#'   `cpod_project_code`, `station_name` and `deploy_date_time`. See also
#'  [field definitions](https://inbo.github.io/etn/articles/etn_fields.html).
