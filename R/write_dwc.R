#' Transform ETN data to Darwin Core
#'
#' Transforms and downloads data from a European Tracking Network
#' **animal project** to [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/).
#' The resulting CSV file(s) can be uploaded to an [IPT](
#' https://www.gbif.org/ipt) for publication to OBIS and/or GBIF.
#' A `meta.xml` or `eml.xml` file are not created.
#'
#' @param connection Connection to the ETN database.
#' @param animal_project_code Animal project code.
#' @param directory Path to local directory to write file(s) to.
#'   If `NULL`, then a list of data frames is returned instead, which can be
#'   useful for extending/adapting the Darwin Core mapping before writing with
#'   [readr::write_csv()].
#' @param rights_holder Acronym of the organization owning or managing the
#'   rights over the data.
#' @param license Identifier of the license under which the data will be
#'   published.
#'   - [`CC-BY`](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) (default).
#'   - [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).
#' @return CSV file(s) written to disk or list of data frames when
#'   `directory = NULL`.

#' @section Transformation details:
#' Data are transformed into an
#' [Occurrence core](https://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_occurrence_2022-02-02.xml).
#' This **follows recommendations** discussed and created by Peter Desmet,
#' Jonas Mortelmans, Jonathan Pye, John Wieczorek and others.
#' See the [SQL file(s)](https://github.com/inbo/etn/tree/main/inst/sql)
#' used by this function for details.
#'
#' Key features of the Darwin Core transformation:
#' - Deployments (animal+tag associations) are parent events, with capture,
#'   surgery, release, recapture (human observations) and acoustic detections
#'   (machine observations) as child events.
#'   No information about the parent event is provided other than its ID,
#'   meaning that data can be expressed in an Occurrence Core with one row per
#'   observation and `parentEventID` shared by all occurrences in a deployment.
#' - The release event often contains metadata about the animal (sex,
#'   lifestage, comments) and deployment as a whole.
#' - Acoustic detections are downsampled to the **first detection per hour**,
#'   to reduce the size of high-frequency data.
#'   Duplicate detections (same animal, tag and timestamp) are excluded.
#'   It is possible for a deployment to contain no detections, e.g. if the
#'   tag malfunctioned right after deployment.
