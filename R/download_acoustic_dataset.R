#' Download acoustic data package
#'
#' Download all acoustic data related to an **animal project** as a data
#' package that can be deposited in a research data repository. Includes option
#' to filter on scientific names.
#'
#' The data are downloaded as a
#' **[Frictionless Data Package](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/data-package/)**
#' containing:
#'
#' file | description
#' --- | ---
#' `animals.csv` | Animals related to an `animal_project_code`, optionally filtered on `scientific_name`(s), as returned by `get_animals()`.
#' `tags.csv` | Tags associated with the selected animals, as returned by `get_tags()`.
#' `detections.csv` | Acoustic detections for the selected animals, as returned by `get_acoustic_detections()`.
#' `deployments.csv` | Acoustic deployments for the `acoustic_project_code`(s) found in detections, as returned by `get_acoustic_deployments()`. This allows users to see when receivers were deployed, even if these did not detect the selected animals.
#' `receivers.csv` | Acoustic receivers for the selected deployments, as returned by `get_acoustic_receivers()`.
#' `datapackage.json` | A [Frictionless Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) metadata file describing the fields and relations of the above csv files. This file is copied from [here](https://github.com/inbo/etn/blob/master/inst/assets/datapackage.json) and can be used to validate the data package.
#'
#' The function will report the number of records per csv file, as well as the
#' included scientific names and acoustic projects. Warnings will be raised for:
#'
#' - Animals with multiple tags
#' - Tags associated with multiple animals
#' - Deployments without acoustic project: these deployments will not be listed
#'   in `deployments.csv` and will therefore raise a foreign key validation
#'   error.
#' - Duplicate detections: detections with the duplicate `detection_id`. These
#'   are removed by the function in `detections.csv`.
#'
#' **Important**: The data are downloaded _as is_ from the database, i.e. no
#' quality or consistency checks are performed by this function. We therefore
#' recommend to verify the data before publication. A consistency check can be
#' performed by validation tools of the Frictionless Framework, e.g.
#' `frictionless validate datapackage.json` on the command line using
#' [frictionless-py](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py).
#'
#' @param animal_project_code Character. Animal project you want to download
#'   data for. Required.
#' @param scientific_name Character (vector). One or more scientific names.
#'   Defaults to no all (all scientific names, include "Sync tag", etc.).
#' @param directory Character. Relative path to local download directory.
#'   Defaults to creating a directory named after animal project code. Existing
#'   files of the same name will be overwritten.
