#' Get acoustic receiver data
#'
#' Get data for acoustic receivers, with options to filter results.
#'
#' @param connection A connection to the ETN database. Defaults to `con`.
#' @param receiver_id Character (vector). One or more receiver identifiers.
#' @param status Character. One or more statuses, e.g. `available` or `broken`.
#'
#' @return A tibble with acoustic receiver data, sorted by `receiver_id`. See
#'   also
#'   [field definitions](https://inbo.github.io/etn/articles/etn_fields.html).
#'   Values for `owner_organization` will only be visible if you are member of
#'   the group.
