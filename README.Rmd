Etn provides functionality to access data from the [European Tracking Network (ETN)](http://www.lifewatch.be/etn/) database hosted by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) as part of the Flemish contribution to LifeWatch. ETN data is subject to the [ETN data policy](http://www.lifewatch.be/etn/assets/docs/ETN-DataPolicy.pdf) and can be:
 
- restricted: under moratorium and only accessible to logged-in data owners/collaborators
- unrestricted: publicly accessible without login and routinely published to international biodiversity facilities
 
The ETN infrastructure currently requires the package to be run within the [LifeWatch.be RStudio server](http://rstudio.lifewatch.be/), which is password protected. A login can be requested at http://www.lifewatch.be/etn/contact.
