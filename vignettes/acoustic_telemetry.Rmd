## Introduction

In this vignette we show a typical workflow using the etn package to retrieve **acoustic telemetry data** from ETN. We will also use the packages [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for data exploration, [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) to handle datetime data and [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) for interactive visualizations.

To start, load the etn package:

```{r load_pkg}
library(etn)
```

And the other packages (with installation if necessary):

```{r load_other_pkgs, message=FALSE}
other_pkgs <- c("dplyr", "lubridate", "leaflet")

# install missing packages
pkgs_to_install <- other_pkgs[!other_pkgs %in% rownames(installed.packages())]
install.packages(pkgs_to_install)

# load packages
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(leaflet)
```

## User credentials

Functions in etn need user credentials to connect to the database. You should have received those from VLIZ. You will be prompted (once per session) for these credentials. To avoid this you can save them as [environment variables](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/managing-credentials/#use-environment-variables).

## Select project(s) of interest

A researcher typically works in the context of one or more _animal projects_. As the project codes are not always easy to remember, let's start by getting an overview of all projects:

```{r get_animal_projects}
all_projects <- get_animal_projects()
```

Show a preview:

```{r preview_first_10_projects}
all_projects %>% head(10)
```

If you know the `project code` already and you are just interested to get more information about it, you can specify it in the `get_animal_projects()` function directly:

```{r get_demer_project_directly}
projects_code <- c("2014_demer", "2015_dijle")
projects_study <- get_animal_projects(animal_project_code = projects_code)
projects_study
```

This is exactly the same as retrieving all projects first and filtering them afterwards based on column `project_code`:

```{r retrieve_all_first_filter_after}
all_projects %>%
  filter(project_code %in% c(projects_code))
```

To list all available animal project codes as a vector, you can use `list_animal_project_codes()`, one of the etn functions in the [`list_*` family](https://inbo.github.io/etn/reference/index.html#section-list-parameter-options):

```{r list_animal_project_codes}
list_animal_project_codes() %>% head(10)
```

## Animals

By using `get_animals()` you can retrieve information about each animal (`animal_id`), such as scientific name, length, capture/release date and location, and the attached tag(s) (`tag_serial_number`):

```{r get_animals}
animals <- get_animals(animal_project_code = projects_code)
animals %>% head(10)
```

What species and how many individuals are tracked for the projects `2014_demer` and `2015_dijle`?

```{r get_species_and_number_individuals}
animals %>%
  count(scientific_name)
```

## Detections

Let's say we are interested in the tracking data of Wels catfish (_Silurus glanis_) in 2014. You can retrieve the detection history using `get_acoustic_detections()`:

```{r get_detections_silurus}
detections_silurus <- get_acoustic_detections(
  animal_project_code = projects_code,
  start_date = "2014-01-01",
  end_date = "2015-01-01", # The end date is exclusive
  scientific_name = "Silurus glanis"
)
```

Preview:

```{r preview_detections_silurus}
detections_silurus %>% head(10)
```

Which individuals have been detected (`animal_id`) and in which period?

```{r detections_silurus_period}
detections_silurus_period <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  mutate(date = date(date_time)) %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  summarize(
    start = min(date),
    end = max(date)
  )
detections_silurus_period
```

Notice we group by `animal_id`, the unique identifier of the fish. However, if the fish has only been tagged  once (as typically occurs), we could use `acoustic_tag_id` as well, i.e. the identifier picked up by acoustic receivers:

```{r group_by_acoustic_tag_id}
detections_silurus %>%
  mutate(date = date(date_time)) %>%
  group_by(acoustic_tag_id) %>%
  summarize(
    start = min(date),
    end = max(date)
  )
```

We can also get the tracking duration of each fish:

```{r duration_tracking}
detections_silurus_duration <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  summarize(duration = max(date_time) - min(date_time))
detections_silurus_duration
```

How many times has an individual has been detected?

```{r n_detections}
detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  count()
```

## Stations

At how many detection stations have the individuals been detected?

```{r n_stations}
detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  distinct(station_name) %>%
  count()
```

Which stations have been involved? You can retrieve them using `list_values` function applied to column `station_name`:

```{r stations_silurus}
stations_silurus <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  list_values(station_name)
stations_silurus
```

Notice how a detection station can be linked to multiple deployments:

```{r link_stations_deployments}
detections_silurus %>%
  distinct(station_name, deployment_id) %>%
  group_by(station_name) %>%
  add_tally() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Sometimes it's interesting to know the number of detections per station:

```{r n_detections_per_deployment}
n_detect_station <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(station_name) %>%
  count()
n_detect_station
```

It's also interesting to know the number of unique individuals per station:

```{r n_silurus_station}
n_silurus_station <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  distinct(station_name, animal_id) %>%
  group_by(station_name) %>%
  count()
n_silurus_station
```

## Acoustic tags 

To get more information about the tags involved in `detections_silurus`, you can use the function `get_tags`, which returns tag related information such as serial number, manufacturer, model, and frequency:

```{r acoustic_tags_info}
tags_id <- list_values(detections_silurus, acoustic_tag_id)
tags_silurus <- get_tags(acoustic_tag_id = tags_id)
tags_silurus
```

You can also retrieve such information by `tag_serial_number`:

```{r acoustic_tags_info_via serial_number}
tags_serial <- unique(detections_silurus$tag_serial_number)
tags_silurus <- get_tags(tag_serial_number = tags_serial)
tags_silurus
```

However, keep in mind that there is a fundamental difference between the arguments `acoustic_tag_id` and `tag_serial_number`: the `tag_serial_number` identifies the _device_, which could contain multiple tags or sensors and thus multiple `acoustic_tag_id`.

All possible `acoustic_tag_id` can be retrieved with the correspondent `list_*` function:

```{r list_acoustic_tag_ids}
list_acoustic_tag_ids() %>% head(10)
```

## Acoustic network projects

The detection of Wels catfishes has been possible thanks to one or more acoustic network projects, mentioned in field `acoustic_project_code`. You can retrieve them via the _list_ function `list_values()`:

```{r acoustic_project_codes_involved}
acoustic_project_codes <- detections_silurus %>% 
  list_values(acoustic_project_code)
acoustic_project_codes
```

To get more information about these acoustic networks, you can use function `get_acoustic_projects()`

```{r get_acoustic_projects}
acoustic_projects_silurus <- get_acoustic_projects(
  acoustic_project_code = acoustic_project_codes
)
acoustic_projects_silurus
```

You can retrieve the full list of acoustic network projects with the correspondent `list_*` function:

```{r list_acoustic_project_codes}
list_acoustic_project_codes() %>% head(10)
```

## Acoustic deployments

You can retrieve deployment information related to the acoustic networks in `acoustic_project_codes` by using `get_acoustic_deployments()` function:

```{r get_acoustic_deployments_info_networks}
deployments <-get_acoustic_deployments(
  acoustic_project_code = acoustic_project_codes
)
deployments
```

These are the deployments of the acoustic receivers involved in `detections_silurus`:

```{r deploys_silurus}
deploys_silurus <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  list_values(deployment_id)
deploys_silurus
```

More information about them can be retrieved via `get_acoustic_deployments()` function with argument `deployment_id`:

```{r get_acoustic_deployments_info}
deployments_silurus <- get_acoustic_deployments(
  deployment_id = deploys_silurus
)
deployments_silurus
```

Deployment duration:

```{r deployment_duration}
deployments_silurus_duration <- 
  deployments_silurus %>% 
  mutate(duration = as.duration(recover_date_time - deploy_date_time)) %>%
  select(deployment_id, station_name, duration) %>%
  arrange(deployment_id)
deployments_silurus_duration
```

Number of days a deployment detected the passage of one or more individuals:

```{r n_active_days_deployments_silurus}
n_active_days_deployments_silurus <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  mutate(date = date(date_time)) %>%
  distinct(deployment_id, station_name, date) %>%
  group_by(deployment_id, station_name) %>%
  summarize(n_days = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ungroup()
n_active_days_deployments_silurus
```

Relative detection duration, i.e. number of days with at least one detection divided by deployment duration:

```{r relative_detection_duration}
rel_det_duration_silurus <- 
  n_active_days_deployments_silurus %>%
  left_join(
    deployments_silurus_duration,
    by = c("deployment_id", "station_name")
  ) %>%
  mutate(relative_detection_duration = n_days*(24*60*60) / as.numeric(duration)) %>%
  select(deployment_id, station_name, relative_detection_duration)
rel_det_duration_silurus
```

## Data visualization

Aside standard graphs, the geographical component of telemetry data makes interactive maps particularly useful. The package `leaflet` is quite popular to create such kind of visualizations. 

We can for example create a map of the involved stations showing the station name and the acoustic project code it belongs to as pop-ups. First, we retrieve the coordinates of the stations:

```{r geo_info_stations}
geo_info_stations <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  distinct(
    station_name, 
    deploy_latitude, 
    deploy_longitude, 
    acoustic_project_code
  ) %>%
  arrange(station_name)
geo_info_stations
```

To be able to produce the desired map:

```{r map_stations}
leaflet(geo_info_stations) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng = ~deploy_longitude,
    lat = ~deploy_latitude,
    popup = ~paste0("Station: ", station_name, " (", acoustic_project_code, ")")
  )
```

We can visualize the number of detections per station, `n_detect_station`, by joining it with `geo_info_stations`:

```{r leaflet_n_detections_Wels_catfish}
# Create a continuous colour palette function
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "viridis",
  domain = n_detect_station$n
)

n_detect_station %>%
  left_join(
    geo_info_stations,
    by = "station_name"
  ) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~deploy_longitude,
    lat = ~deploy_latitude,
    radius = ~log(n),
    color = ~pal(n),
    fillOpacity = 0.8,
    stroke = FALSE,
    popup = ~paste(
      sep = "<br/>",
      paste0("Station: ", station_name, " (", acoustic_project_code, ")"),
      paste0("# detections: ", n)
    )
  ) %>% 
  addLegend(
    title = "Detections",
    pal = pal,
    values = ~n
  )
```

In a similar way we can visualize the number of detected individuals per station, `n_silurus_station`:

```{r map_n_individuals_per_station}
# Create a continuous colour palette function
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "viridis",
  domain = n_silurus_station$n
)

n_silurus_station %>%
  left_join(
    geo_info_stations,
    by = "station_name"
  ) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~deploy_longitude,
    lat = ~deploy_latitude,
    radius = ~n,
    color = ~pal(n),
    fillOpacity = 0.8,
    stroke = FALSE,
    popup = ~paste(
      sep = "<br/>",
      paste0("Station: ", station_name, " (", acoustic_project_code, ")"),
      paste0("# detected individuals: ", n)
    )
  ) %>% 
  addLegend(
    title = "Detected individuals",
    pal = pal,
    values = ~n
  )
```

We can also make a map of the relative detection duration of the deployments. First, we have to retrieve the deployment geographical coordinates:

```{r geo_info_deployments}
geo_info_deploys <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  distinct(
    deployment_id, 
    deploy_latitude, 
    deploy_longitude, 
    station_name,
    acoustic_project_code
  ) %>%
  arrange(station_name)
geo_info_deploys
```

We are ready to create the desired map, where we show the deployment ID, the station name and the network project as popups:

```{r map_rel_detection_duration_deploys}
# Create a continuous colour palette function
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "viridis",
  domain = rel_det_duration_silurus$relative_detection_duration
)

rel_det_duration_silurus %>%
  left_join(
    geo_info_deploys,
    by = c("deployment_id", "station_name")
  ) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(
    lng = ~deploy_longitude,
    lat = ~deploy_latitude,
    radius = ~100*relative_detection_duration,
    color = ~pal(relative_detection_duration),
    fillOpacity = 0.8,
    stroke = FALSE,
    clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),
    popup = ~paste(
      sep = "<br/>",
      paste0("DeploymentID: ", deployment_id),
      paste0("Station: ", station_name, " (", acoustic_project_code, ")"),
      paste0("# relative detection duration: ", round(relative_detection_duration, 2))
    )
  ) %>% 
  addLegend(
    title = "Relative detection duration",
    pal = pal,
    values = ~relative_detection_duration
  )
```
