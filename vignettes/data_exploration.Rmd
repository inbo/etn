## Introduction

In this vignette we show a typical workflow using `etn` package to retrieve data and the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) R pacakges collection to perform basic data exploration.

To start, load the `etn`package:

```{r load_pkg}
library(etn)
```

and connect with your user credentials (as received by VLIZ) to the database:

```{r connect_to_db}
con <- connect_to_etn(Sys.getenv("userid"), Sys.getenv("pwd"))
```

We also load other packages for data exploration:

```{r load_other_pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Select project(s) of interest

First we need to know which projects we need. As the project names are not easy to remember, it is always good to start by an overview of all projects we have access to:

```{r get_my_projects}
my_projects <- get_projects()
```

Typically we are interested in animal projects. You can filter by `project_type`:

```{r}
my_projects<- 
  my_projects %>%
  filter(project_type == "animal")
# show the first 10 projects
my_projects %>%
  head(10)
```

or you can specify the type of project in the `get_projects()` function directly:

```{r get_my_projects_directly}
my_projects <- get_projects(project_type = "animal")
# show the first 10 projects
my_projects %>%
  head(10)
```

Let's say we are interested in the data from projects `2012_leopoldkanaal` and `2013_albertkanaal`:

```{r projects_study}
projects_study <- c("2014_demer", "2013_albertkanaal")
```

We can get the time span of these projects by checking the columns `start_date` and `end_date`:

```{r start_end_date}
my_projects %>%
  filter(project_code %in% c(projects_study)) %>% 
  select(start_date, end_date)
```


## Data exploration

### Animals under study

Which species and how many individuals have been tracked during these projects?

```{r get_species_and_number_individuals}
animals <- get_animals(animal_project_code = projects_study)
animals %>%
  count(scientific_name)
```

Let's say we are interested in the tracking data of Wels catfish (_Silurus glanis_) between begin 2014 and end 2015:

```{r get_detections_silurus}
detections_silurus <- get_detections(animal_project_code = projects_study,
                                     start_date = "2014-01-01",
                                     end_date = "2015-12-31",
                                     scientific_name = "Silurus glanis")
```

### Detection history

Which fishes have been detected (`animal_id`) and in which period?

```{r detections_silurus_period}
detections_silurus_period <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  mutate(date = date(date_time)) %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  summarise(start = min(date),
            end = max(date))
detections_silurus_period
```

We can also get the tracking duration:

```{r duration_tracking}
detections_silurus_duration <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  summarise(duration = max(date_time) - min(date_time))
detections_silurus_duration
```

How many detections per fish?

```{r n_detections}
detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  count()
```

Along how many deployments (stations) have the fishes been detected?

```{r}
detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(animal_id) %>%
  distinct(station_name) %>%
  count()
```

### Deployments

Which deployments have been involved?

```{r deployments_silurus}
deployments_silurus <-
  detections_silurus %>%
  select(starts_with("deploy"), station_name) %>%
  distinct()
deployments_silurus
```

Create a map of the involved deployments:

```{r map_deployments}
leaflet(deployments_silurus) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng = ~deploy_longitude,
             lat = ~deploy_latitude,
             popup = ~htmlEscape(paste0(station_name, " (", deployment_fk, ")")))
```

Sometimes it's interesting to know the number of detections per deployment:

```{r n_detections_per_deployment}
detections_silurus %>%
  group_by(deployment_fk, station_name) %>%
  count()
```

More information about the specific deployments can be retrieved by `get_deployments()` function. First we get the network projects involved: 

```{r networks_involved}
networks_silurus <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  distinct(network_project_code)
networks_silurus
```

and based on this information we can retrieve the metadata about the deployments. Be careful to set `open_only` equal to `FALSE` to get all deployments. To get the specific deployments, a filter on deployment's primary key is needed:

```{r get_deployment_info}
deployments_silurus <-
  # get all deployments from the involved networks
  get_deployments(network_project_code = networks_silurus$network_project_code,
                  open_only = FALSE) %>%
  # filter the deployments based on their unique identifier
  filter(pk %in% detections_silurus$deployment_fk)

deployments_silurus
```

Deployment duration:

```{r deployment_duration}
deployments_silurus_duration <- 
  deployments_silurus %>%
  mutate(duration = recover_date_time - deploy_date_time) %>%
  select(pk, station_name, duration)
deployments_silurus_duration
```

Number of days a deployment detected the passage of one or more fishes:

```{r n_active_days_deployments_silurus}
n_active_days_deployments_silurus <- 
  detections_silurus %>%
  mutate(date = date(date_time)) %>%
  distinct(deployment_fk, station_name, date) %>%
  group_by(deployment_fk, station_name) %>%
  summarise(n_days = n())
n_active_days_deployments_silurus
```

Proportion of active days:

```{r}
n_active_days_deployments_silurus %>%
  left_join(deployments_silurus_duration,
            by = c("deployment_fk" = "pk", "station_name")) %>%
  mutate(relative_detection_duration = n_days / duration) %>%
  select(deployment_fk, station_name, relative_detection_duration)
```
